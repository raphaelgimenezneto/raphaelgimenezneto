**I specialize in:**

*   🚀 **High-Performance Computing:** Accelerating Python code with Numba, NumPy, and optimized algorithms.
*   🔬 **Scientific & Numerical Simulation:** Building physics-based models and data generation pipelines from the ground up.
*   🛠️ **Reproducible Systems:** Engineering robust workflows with version control, metadata, and clear documentation.
